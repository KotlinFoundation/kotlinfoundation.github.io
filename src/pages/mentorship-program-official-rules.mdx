Sponsor’s or its designee’s computer is the official time-keeping device for the Program. All entries must be received during the Program Period unless otherwise stated in these Official Rules and meet other requirements in these Official Rules to be eligible to win a prize. Proof of entry does not constitute proof of receipt by Sponsor.

# 3\. How to Enter

To apply during the Application Period, complete the steps below:

* Step 1: Apply as either a Mentor or a Mentee.
* Step 2: Submit the required information through the official Program application form(s) made available by Sponsor (each, an “Application”). Applications must be submitted by the deadline stated in Section 2\. All information in your Application must be truthful, complete, and not misleading.

By submitting an application as instructed above (an “Application”), you agree that your Application conforms to the Guidelines and Restrictions below. Sponsor may choose to remove any Application or disqualify you from the Program if it believes that your Application fails to conform with the Guidelines and Restrictions. Upon completion of all required entry steps and compliance with the Guidelines and Restrictions, you will be considered an applicant to the Program (an “Applicant”). Participation is not guaranteed; selection is limited.

Limit: One entry per person during program period. Any attempt to obtain additional entries, including through multiple or duplicate accounts will result in disqualification.

## Application Guidelines and Restrictions:

1. Your Application must not include or refer to untruthful, incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information.
2. Your Application must not (in Sponsor’s discretion): (i) violate any third-party rights, including copyrights, trademark rights, or rights of privacy and publicity; (ii) contain disparaging or defamatory statements; (iii) include threats to any person, place, business, or group; (iv) be obscene, offensive, or indecent; (v) depict any risky behavior; (vi) contain material that promotes bigotry, racism, hatred or harm against any group or individual or promotes discrimination based on race, gender, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age; or (vii) contain unauthorized third-party trademarks or logos.
3. You represent and warrant that: (i) the Application does not violate any applicable law, rule or regulation; (ii) to the extent the Application depicts any individual or features the voice or other qualities of any individual, you are the individual pictured, heard, or otherwise featured in the Submission, or, alternatively, that you have obtained written permission from each person appearing in the entry to grant the rights to Sponsor described in these Official Rules, and will make written copies of such permissions available to Sponsor upon request; and (iii) the Application complies with all requirements of these Official Rules.

# 4\. Identity of Applicant / Participant

All Applications must be submitted by the individual entrant. Team entries are not allowed. Bulk or automated Applications will be disqualified (including entries made using any script, macro, bot, or promotional service). Multiple participants are not permitted to share the same email for entry. Any attempt to obtain additional entries through fraud or other illegitimate means will result in disqualification, at Sponsor’s discretion.

If there is a dispute about the identity of the entrant, Applications will be declared made by the authorized account holder of the email address or social media account submitted or associated with the Application. An “authorized account holder” means the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address. A potential winner may be required to provide Sponsor with proof that a potential winner is the authorized account holder of the account associated with the winning Application.

# 5\. Selection, Matching, and Notification

## A. Selection of Participants and matching

On or about the Matching Date, Sponsor will review Applications, in its sole discretion, and select participants for the Program. The Program is limited in size; Sponsor expects to form approximately 10 Mentor–Mentee pairings (the “Pairs”), though Sponsor may adjust cohort size.

Sponsor will match selected Mentors and Mentees in its sole discretion based on factors such as (non-exhaustively): project fit, participant interests, time availability, expected mentorship capacity, and timezone/communication constraints. Sponsor’s decisions regarding selection and matching are final and binding.

Selected Applicants will be notified via email (or other contact method provided in the Application) and may be required to confirm participation by a specified deadline. Failure to timely confirm may result in forfeiture of the participation slot and selection of an alternate participant.

## B. Completion and eligibility for rewards and prizes

The Program’s intended outcome is that a Mentee makes at least one “Meaningful Contribution” to a Kotlin-related open-source project with Mentor support during the Cohort Period.

For purposes of these Official Rules, a Meaningful Contribution means at least one change that a project maintainer (including, where applicable, the Mentor acting in that capacity) accepts as useful. This may include code (for example, a merged pull request), documentation, tutorials, examples, tooling, issue triage, or other contribution types, as determined by Sponsor in Sponsor’s discretion.

Sponsor may require reasonable evidence of completion (for example, a link to a merged pull request or accepted change, and/or a short confirmation by the Mentor).

Only Pairs that Sponsor verifies as having completed the Program in accordance with these Official Rules are eligible for (i) the completion merchandise reward, and (ii) entry into the prize drawing for the KotlinConf trip (each as described in Section 6).

## C. Prize winner selection and notification

On or about April 15, 2026, Sponsor (or its designee) will select one (1) Pair at random from among all eligible completed Pairs to be the potential prize winners (the “Potential Winners”). Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible completed Pairs.

Sponsor will notify the Potential Winners via email (or other contact method provided). To claim the prize, each Potential Winner must follow the instructions in the notification.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Sponsor may require each Potential Winner to sign and return, within seven (7) days after being notified, an affidavit of eligibility, liability and publicity release, and other legal, regulatory, or tax-related documents required in Sponsor’s discretion (the “Affidavit and Related Documents”) in order to claim a prize.

If: (i) attempted notification is returned as undeliverable; (ii) required documentation is not completed and returned within the specified timeframe; or (iii) a Potential Winner is otherwise unable to accept the prize as stated, the prize may be forfeited and awarded to an alternate Pair.

Sponsor may select up to three (3) alternate Pairs. After that, any remaining unclaimed prize may go unawarded. All determinations by Sponsor are final and binding, and are made in the Sponsor’s sole discretion.

Verification of Potential Winner: Each potential winner is subject to verification by Sponsor, whose decisions are final and binding in all matters related to the Contest. An entrant is not a prize winner unless and until entrant’s eligibility has been verified and entrant has been notified that verification is complete and no further action is needed.

# 6\. Rewards and Prize

## A. Completion reward: Kotlin Foundation merchandise

Subject to these Official Rules and Sponsor verification of Program completion:

* Each eligible completing Mentor and Mentee will receive one Kotlin Foundation merchandise package (a “Merchandise Reward”).
* The maximum number of Merchandise Rewards is expected to be twenty (20) total (for example, 10 Mentors \+ 10 Mentees), but Sponsor may adjust based on Program size and verification outcomes.

Sponsor may require shipping information and other reasonable details to fulfill the Merchandise Reward. Sponsor is not responsible for undeliverable shipments due to incorrect information provided by a Participant.

## B. Prize: KotlinConf 2026 trip for one Pair

One (1) selected Pair (two individuals: one Mentor and one Mentee) will each receive (i) a flight, lodging, and ticket to attend the KotlinConf main conference Munich, Germany from May 21 \- 22, 2026 (Approximate Retail Value: (“ARV”): $3,000 USD per person).

Sponsor will provide round trip (economy) coach-class airfare for the winner from an airport close to the winner’s home to Munich. Sponsor or its designee will determine which airport is closest to the winner’s home. Sponsor will provide ground transportation (1) to and from airport to winner’s home and (2) to and from destination airport to lodging of winner at the prize trip destination at a reasonable cost, of a total amount not exceeding $400 USD. Sponsor will provide winner lodging for one person for three nights at a location in Munich. Travel arrangements are subject to availability at the discretion of Sponsor. Blackout periods and other restrictions, conditions, and/or limitations may apply. Air transportation, hotel accommodations, ground transportation, and other elements of prize are determined by Sponsor or its designee and must be taken together and cannot be taken separately. Sponsor or its designee will not replace any lost or stolen tickets, travel vouchers or certificates or similar items once they are in the winner’s possession.

Any amendment fees or charges incurred due to any changes to the purchased flights are the responsibility of the winner. All costs not explicitly specified in these Official Rules are the sole responsibility of the winner, and Sponsor will not provide any compensation or reimbursement for these costs, including visa requirements, valid passports, travel insurance, spending money, meals, taxes (excluding airline and airport taxes), vaccinations, transfers, items of a personal nature, excess baggage, in-room charges, other ancillary costs, and any applicable insurance excesses. Air travel is subject to the airline’s conditions of carriage.

Prize Restrictions: Prizes are not transferable. No substitutions or exchanges of any prize (including for cash) will be permitted, except that Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a prize of comparable or greater value for any prize. Only the number of prizes stated in these Official Rules are available to be won in the Program. Limit one prize per person. Sponsor will not replace any lost or stolen prizes or prize components. Except for applicable manufacturer’s standard warranties, the prizes are awarded “AS IS” and without warranty of any kind, express or implied (including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). Any unclaimed or unused prize (or portion of the prize package) will remain the property of Sponsor.

All federal, state and local taxes associated with the receipt or use of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner.
