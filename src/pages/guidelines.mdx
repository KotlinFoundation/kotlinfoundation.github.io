# Kotlin brand assets usage guidelines

One of the goals of The Kotlin Foundation is to protect the use of the Kotlin word, Kotlin logo and other distinctive visual assets and to make sure they are not misused. The following guidelines provide guidance on how to reference and use them. Kotlin brand assets consist of the word trademark “Kotlin”, Kotlin logo, Kotlin community logo and the mascot Kodee (hereinafter as “**Guidelines**”).

The below text elaborates on the specific use cases and conditions for each of the above. To make your life easier we are summarizing the main rules below. (Nevertheless, please pay attention to the complete wording of these guidelines, as the summary is not exhaustive.)

**Kotlin word trademark** \- the word Kotlin is to be used when referring to the Kotlin programming language, and we want to avoid it being used to refer to any other programming language, or used in any way that may imply that the language is not free nor open source.

**Kotlin logo** \- is to be used for official purposes, in order to designate official Kotlin materials and activities approved by the Kotlin Foundation, it is not to be modified or combined with other visual elements. Kotlin icons are used in special cases to refer to the programming language.

**Kotlin User Group logo** \- it can be used by [Kotlin User Group](https://kotlinlang.org/community/user-groups/). Its use should comply with the license conditions specified below and maintain graphic uniformity.

**Kotlin mascot Kodee** \- we encourage you to use Kodee freely with no specific restrictions when referring to Kotlin, it is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Complete wording of the Guidelines

# General rules

None of the Kotlin Brand Assets may be used for any disparaging activity against Kotlin or in any discriminatory, insulting or inappropriate manner, the assessment of which is solely at our discretion. Kotlin Foundation is entitled to enforce these Guidelines in their entirety (also in respect of the brand assets copyrighted by JetBrains). Where applicable, we (or JetBrains) reserve the right to revoke any license granted to you.

# I. Kotlin word trademark (“Trademark”)

## Permitted uses

Given the open nature of Kotlin, you may use the Trademark to refer to the Kotlin programming language. Examples of these references include the following:

- Identify that your software is written in the Kotlin programming language
- Is compatible with the Kotlin programming language
- Targets the Kotlin programming language
- Is for use with the Kotlin programming language
- Contains the Kotlin programming language.
- Aims to promote or teach the Kotlin programming language

The use must be referential and describe the relationship of your products or services to the Kotlin programming language.

## Unpermitted uses

The Trademark may never be used in a manner that would cause confusion as to JetBrains, Google, or the Kotlin Foundation’s sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement, including as part of a company name, product name, domain name, or business trading name. Other than as allowed herein, the Kotlin word mark should not be combined with other trademarks, terms, or source identifiers.

Under no circumstances can you claim any trademark rights in the Kotlin name or attempt to register a name or source identifier that incorporates the Kotlin trademark or logo, or anything confusingly thereto, as a trademark, domain name, business name or other source identifier.

## Usage guidelines

Please follow these guidelines when referencing the Trademark:

- The first or most prominent mention of the Kotlin trademark should be immediately followed by the ®symbol. For example "Kotlin ® ..." This requirement is waived in all contexts where such marks are not normally included, such as non-marketing emails, online discussions, and academic papers. We encourage the use of the ® symbol whenever possible, but recognize that many non-commercial and informal uses will omit it.
- Where identifying that a product or service is built on the Kotlin programming language or runs the Kotlin programming language, use the product’s own name followed by “in Kotlin®”, “for Kotlin®”, “compatible with Kotlin®”, “running Kotlin®” etc. Do not incorporate Kotlin into the product name.
- User groups, communities and/or meet-ups should follow the naming convention "\{XYZ\} Kotlin User Group" where \{XYZ\} represents the location and optionally other wordings.
- Do not display the word Kotlin using any different stylization, color, or font from the surrounding text.
- Don’t use the trademark as verb (“Kotlin your code”), or create derivatives of it such as “Kotlinize”, etc.
- Do not use Kotlin in possessive form (i.e. Kotlin’s).
- Do not use alternative spellings (e.g., “Ktln”).
- In certain usage context, and at the discretion of the Trademark Subcommittee of The Kotlin Foundation, you may need to add a disclaimer on your site, publication, book, product, etc. where it clearly indicates that the product and/or service provided is not associated with The Kotlin Foundation.

## Example usages

### User groups and Kotlin meetups

A valid name for a user group could be “San Diego Kotlin User Group” If you’re a user group or Kotlin meetup, please use the User Group assets provided \- see below.

### Events

If you’re organizing a conference or educational event, you can use the word Kotlin to refer to the technology that the event covers. However, Kotlin cannot be contained in the brand name for your conference or educational event (such as KotlinConf or Kotlin Conference). Instead, you should use your own brand name, but indicate that it is a conference for “Kotlin Language Users.” Your conference or educational event title also should not cause any confusion or suggest any affiliation with or sponsorship by the Kotlin Foundation. Example of appropriate usages could be “XYZ Conference for Kotlin” with XYZ being your own brand name.

### Other commercial or non-commercial names

Whether you’re referring to a product, company or service, you shouldn’t incorporate Kotlin as your brand name, i.e. your company cannot be called “Kotlin Consulting” or “Kotlin IDE”. It can however indicate that you provide consulting for the Kotlin programming language as part of the description. For example, XYZ Consulting, which focuses on the Kotlin programming language.


# II. Kotlin logo

<img src={kotlinLogo} alt="Kotlin Logo" alt="Kotlin logo" width="100%" />

#
The Kotlin logo is a distinctive symbol of the Kotlin Foundation and the Kotlin programming language. To ensure proper usage, the Kotlin logo may only be used for official or pre-approved purposes.

# III. Kotlin icon

<img src={kotlinIcon} alt="Kotlin Icon" alt="Kotlin Icon" width="150px" />

#
We respect that there are cases where using a visual element is convenient or even desired. Especially when you want to refer to Kotlin to describe its compatibility, features, support or refer to the language as such, and where using the word mark is not easily possible.

### Permitted uses

- Using the icon among other programming languages icons to refer to Kotlin language
- Using the icon in your project’s sources to prominently show that a certain file is written in Kotlin language

### Unpermitted uses

- Use on your website in a way that may suggest support, endorsement or affiliation with Kotlin Foundation when there is none
- Use in product and/or plugin icons
- Use on merchandise, stickers
- Use for promotion of an event or conference
- Use to refer to any other programming language

Should you be in need of using a visual element in order to refer to the Kotlin language in unpermitted cases, you may want to reach for the Kodee mascot which is free to use. (see below).

In case you have our approval to use the Kotlin logo, you must obey the following **graphic guidelines**, unless agreed otherwise.

# IV. Mascot Kodee

Kodee is Kotlin's mascot created by JetBrains. Kodee is more than just a symbol, Kodee is your friendly companion who’s there to encourage and inspire you to express your creativity. Thus, we want you to use it as freely as possible. To achieve that, Kodee is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License.

# V. Kotlin User Group (“KUG”) logo

<img src={kugLogo} alt="KUG Logo" alt="KUG Logo" width="150px" />

JetBrains provides the Kotlin community with a logo that is specifically designed to be recognizable and convey a reference to Kotlin while keeping a clear distinction between what is officially approved and what is not.

As elaborated above, the official Kotlin logo is associated with the language itself and the Kotlin Foundation. It should not be used otherwise in different scopes and situations, as this could cause confusion.

Nevertheless, there is one exception: the KUG logo, which derives from the original logo and is perceived as a standalone logo.

The KUG logo ensures that the opinions and actions of the community remain clearly independent of those of the Kotlin team. Your opinions don't have to agree with ours, and we think this is the most beneficial model for a creative and strong community.

The KUG logo has been created by JetBrains in order to support the Kotlin community. JetBrains grants you a license to use the KUG logo on a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free basis for the purposes of identifying with the Kotlin community based upon your location. The logo cannot be modified without prior written consent from JetBrains, with the exception of specifying the location of the Kotlin User Group. You may use the logo as long as it remains clear that the activities of the Kotlin User Group are not supported nor affiliated with the Kotlin Foundation and do not violate other provisions of the Guidelines. You do not have to necessarily include the classic attribution notice, since we realize that it may not be suitable for most use-cases, nevertheless, we kindly ask you to respect the copyright ownership.
