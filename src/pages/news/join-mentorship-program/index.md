The Kotlin Foundation is launching the Kotlin Ecosystem Mentorship program.

Many developers want to contribute to Kotlin-related open-source projects but don’t know where to start or feel intimidated about contributing. At the same time, maintainers are overwhelmed. This program is designed to fix that.

**How it works:**
We pair an experienced Kotlin open-source maintainer (mentor) with someone making their first meaningful contribution (mentee). Mentors guide mentees through the full journey: setting up the project, understanding the workflow, choosing a reasonable first task, reviewing changes, and giving feedback until the contribution is merged.

**What counts as a contribution?**
It’s not restricted to just code. Documentation, tooling, examples, tutorials, and other project improvements are welcome – as long as the mentor considers the contribution meaningful.

**Pilot details:**
• Timeline: February 16 – April 16
• Mentors: ~30–60 minutes/week
• Mentees: ~2–4 hours/week (depending on the task)
• Pilot size: ~10 mentor-mentee pairs

**Perks:**
Every pair that successfully merges a meaningful contribution will receive some Kotlin swag. One randomly selected finishing pair will win a trip to KotlinConf 2026 in Munich.

If you maintain a Kotlin-related open-source project and want to mentor a new contributor, we’d love to have you join.
