We’re excited to announce that [the Kotlin Foundation Grant Program](/grants/) is back for the third time in 2025. If you’re building and maintaining open-source tools, libraries, or frameworks that support the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem or AI, this program is for you.

The grant offers financial support and recognition for developers who are helping move the ecosystem forward. We don’t claim any ownership over your work, which means you’ll retain all IP and trademarks. Our goal is simply to support meaningful contributions and help them grow.

To be eligible, projects should meet a couple of criteria:

- **Open-source license**. The project should use a permissive open-source license to ensure it remains accessible to everyone and contributes positively to the Kotlin ecosystem.

- **Active maintenance**. The project should be actively maintained and show a history of development and community engagement.

[Submit your grant proposals](/grants/) before **June 25, 2025**. Submissions will be reviewed by the Kotlin Foundation’s Ecosystem Committee based on impact, project quality, and alignment with Kotlin best practices.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out at **grants@kotlinfoundation.org** or join the conversation in the [#kotlin-foundation](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/archives/C04RQTY5PBP) Slack channel.
