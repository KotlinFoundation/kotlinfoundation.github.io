Our [2024 Annual Report](https://kotlinfoundation.org/kf_annual_report_2024.pdf) is now available,
offering an overview of last year’s initiatives and milestones within the Kotlin ecosystem.
The report covers significant programs such as the Kotlin Multiplatform Student Contest,
the Grants Program, and our ongoing involvement in Google Summer of Code.
These efforts have continued to foster community engagement and drive the ecosystem’s growth.

2024 marked the addition of new Silver Members: Kotzilla and Uber, enhancing our ability to launch impactful projects.
The report details how these partnerships have contributed to advancing the Kotlin ecosystem
