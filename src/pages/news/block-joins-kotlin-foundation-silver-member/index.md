We’re excited to announce that **Block, Inc.** has joined the **Kotlin Foundation** as a Silver Member!

Block is dedicated to increasing access to the global economy through its innovative technology. With brands like **[Square](https://squareup.com/), [Cash App](https://cash.app/), Afterpay, [TIDAL](https://tidal.com/), [Bitkey](https://bitkey.world/)**, and **[Proto](https://proto.xyz/)**, Block is making significant strides in transforming commerce, finance, and digital services for everyone.

This milestone highlights a special, shared history between our engineering teams and the Kotlin community. Block’s journey with Kotlin dates back to 2015, when **Square** became one of the early adopters of Kotlin for Android, choosing Kotlin for production with **Project Kotlin**.

This deep commitment to Kotlin is more than just adoption – Block has actively contributed to Kotlin’s ecosystem. Square’s engineers have developed several popular open-source libraries like **OkHttp**, the default HTTP client on Android, and **Okio**, which has now inspired Kotlinx-io, JetBrains’ new multiplatform I/O library. These libraries set benchmarks in reliability and performance, and have been Kotlin-friendly from the start. Additionally, Block’s early adoption of **Kotlin Multiplatform** allowed their teams to collaborate on a single codebase, sharing business logic across Android, iOS, and backend systems.

As a Silver Member, Block will continue to support the Kotlin community through funding, expertise, and participation in shaping the future of Kotlin. Their involvement helps ensure Kotlin’s continued growth, especially in industries like fintech.

In addition to Block’s exciting partnership, we’re also celebrating [**Meta** joining as a Gold Member](/news/meta-joins-kotlin-foundation-first-gold-member/).

We’re excited to collaborate with both Block and Meta, and look forward to the valuable expertise and scale they’ll bring to the Kotlin Foundation’s mission.

Let’s keep shaping the future of Kotlin—together.
