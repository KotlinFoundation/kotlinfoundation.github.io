Held annually by the Kotlin Foundation, the [Kotlin Multiplatform Contest](https://kotlinconf.com/contest/) invites students and recent graduates to showcase their skills and explore multiplatform development. Participants create cross-platform apps that run on Android, iOS, desktop, web, and server, demonstrating the versatility of the Kotlin Multiplatform technology.

This year’s response was nothing short of inspiring – we received 55 submissions with 38 eligible entries that met all the contest requirements. After careful deliberation, our panel of judges from the Kotlin Foundation is proud to recognize the top three projects that stood out for their innovation, creativity, technical excellence, and practical impact.

Congratulations to the winners\!
