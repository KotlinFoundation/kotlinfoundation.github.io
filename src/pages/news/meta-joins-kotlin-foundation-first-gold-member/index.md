We’re excited to announce that **Meta** has joined the Kotlin Foundation as the first **Gold Member**. Welcoming such a major technology leader adds a great perspective from a company operating at scale, and opens up new possibilities to help us to achieve our mission to have Kotlin everywhere.

Meta has long been an advocate for modern, expressive programming languages, and Kotlin has played an increasingly important role in their development practices. From Android apps to multiplatform exploration, Kotlin has become a strategic part of Meta’s developer toolkit.

Meta has also been an active contributor to the wider ecosystem. Notably, they were one of the founding participants of the **[enterprise Java-to-Kotlin working group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POmlM7OshwA)**—a collaborative effort with Google, JetBrains, and Uber aimed at supporting companies migrating large Java codebases to Kotlin. This group continues to help shape tooling, best practices, and large-scale migration strategies.

In addition, Meta supports important infrastructure efforts in the Kotlin ecosystem, including work on the **Kotlin and Android build toolchain in [Buck](https://buck2.build/)** with a focus on improving build speeds and scalability, as well as contributions to libraries such as the **Kotlin formatter**, helping teams maintain consistent and idiomatic Kotlin codebases more easily.

As a Gold Member of the Kotlin Foundation, Meta will contribute to key initiatives such as the **Kotlin Grants program** for OSS contributors and educational efforts like the **Kotlin Multiplatform student contest**.

We’re really happy to collaborate with Meta and look forward to the expertise and scale they bring to the Foundation’s mission.

Let’s keep shaping the future of Kotlin—together.
