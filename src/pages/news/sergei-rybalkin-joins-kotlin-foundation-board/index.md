We‚Äôre excited to welcome Sergei Rybalkin, Senior Staff Software Engineer at Meta, as the newest member of the Kotlin Foundation Board.

With Meta joining as a Gold Member, Sergei brings over a decade of hands-on experience in advancing Kotlin across large-scale, production environments.

Before Meta, Sergei championed Kotlin adoption at Alibaba Group, working on server-side architecture, function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms, and JVM frameworks. He‚Äôs also the author of open-source tools like **Kohttp**, and a contributor to **Redex**, Meta‚Äôs Android bytecode optimizer and **Buck2**, a build tool for large scale code based that supports Kotlin and Android.

A frequent speaker at events like FOSDEM and Kotlin Dev Day, Sergei is known in the community for his practical, performance-focused talks that address real-world challenges in Kotlin development at scale.

He joins the Foundation at a pivotal moment in our mission to bring **Kotlin everywhere**‚Äîacross platforms, industries, and teams. With his technical leadership and community perspective, Sergei will play a key role in shaping the future of the language and its ecosystem.

Please join us in giving him a warm welcome! üëè
