<GrantsTitle>Grants program</GrantsTitle>

The Kotlin Foundation’s goal is to enhance the Kotlin ecosystem and facilitate its sustainable development.
That’s why we're [offering grants](/news/grants-program-goes-live/) to support developers in creating and maintaining open source libraries, tools, and frameworks.

Prospective projects will be selected for grants based on their ability to meet the following criteria:
 * How well the project addresses a common problem in the Kotlin ecosystem, with a bias toward multiplatform solutions.
 * How effectively the project has been able to respond to security issues and bug reports, as well as Kotlin and library updates.
 * Whether or not the project adheres to the library [development best practices](https://kotl.in/api-guide).
 * Outlines a strategy for improvements to the project.
