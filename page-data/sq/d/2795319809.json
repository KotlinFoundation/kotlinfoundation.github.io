Working on the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin, she integrated Gradle’s Problems API and Reporting API, creating richer, standardized reports and exploring parallel verification for faster builds. Guided by Jakub Chrzanowski from JetBrains, she strengthened key workflows used by thousands of plugin developers. Project page\n\nMentor: Jakub Chrzanowski (JetBrains)\n\nAbout the author\n\nI am Victoria Chuks Alajemba, a software engineer passionate about developer tooling from Nigeria. I’ve been building mobile applications professionally since 2021, after learning programming via YouTube in 2020, and I am currently exploring the world of plugins and extensions across several platforms like the IntelliJ Platform, VS Code, Chrome, and more. I love developer tools and programming in general, but more than that, I love the idea of being able to create something that solves a problem. I currently study artificial intelligence and data science for businesses at aivancity School of AI & Data for Business & Technology in Paris.\n\nIntro and motivation\nWhy this project matters\n\nThe IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is a critical tool for developers building plugins that target the IntelliJ Platform. It is used by JetBrains and third-party developers to build, test, verify, and publish their plugins. Improvements to this tool will ensure that the thousands of developers who rely on it have a great experience.\n\nThe problem it solves\n\nThe verifyPlugin task, a Gradle task that is part of the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin, enables developers to check that their plugin works against various IntelliJ-based IDEs (PyCharm, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, and more). However, the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin team had identified certain areas for enhancement:\n\nNon-standard reporting: The verifyPlugin task used its own custom reporting system rather than Gradle's Reporting API, making reports less configurable and harder to integrate with standard Gradle workflows. Limited error context: Build issues that were reported could benefit from a more detailed and structured process with the Problems API. Unclear performance characteristics: We needed to investigate whether parallel execution could speed up verification against multiple IDE versions.\nTechnical highlights\nCore technical achievements\nGradle Problems API integration ✅ Merged PR #1987\nReplaced ad-hoc error reporting in VerifyPluginTask with Gradle's structured Problems API. Enhanced error reporting with contextual details, file locations, suggested solutions, and documentation links.\nGradle Reporting API integration ✅ Merged PR #2016\nImplemented VerifyPluginConfigurationReportsImpl with ReportContainer<SingleFileReport> for standardized reporting. Added TXT report support with configurable output locations via the Gradle DSL. Integrated the Reporting<VerifyPluginConfigurationReports> interface for task-level report configuration. Demonstrated successful Reporting API usage in simpler validation contexts.\nGradle Reporting API for VerifyPluginTask 🔄 Draft PR #1996\nImplemented ReportingContainer supporting HTML, Markdown, and plain text reports. Exposed configuration through IntelliJPlatformExtension for user customization. Blocked by IntelliJ Plugin Verifier's single output directory limitation.\nParallel verification research 🔍 Closed PR #1948\nPrototyped a Gradle Worker API for concurrent verifyPlugin execution against multiple IDE versions. Discovered IntelliJ Plugin Verifier already uses internal ExecutorService concurrency. Identified the true bottleneck: sequential IDE dependency downloads (not verification).

Her project integrated the Gradle Problems API into popular tools like Detekt and Ktlint, unifying error reporting across consoles, IDEs, and HTML reports for cleaner, more actionable feedback. Project page\n\nMentors: Donát Csikós and Reinhold Degenfellner (both from Gradle)\n\nAbout the autor\n\nHey everyone, my name is Vanessa Johnson, and I am an Android Engineer based in New York City. I’ve been at my company for a little over a year now and was excited about the opportunity to take part in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025. My proposal was Enhanced Kotlin Code Quality Reporting with Gradle Problem API: Integration with Detekt and Ktlint.\n\nMotivation\n\nAs developers, we always favor tools that enhance and streamline the programming process, including plugins that provide error reporting and insights to improve code quality. Kotlin developers using Gradle rely on tools like Detekt and Ktlint to enforce code quality. This project aimed to implement a unified and actionable code quality reporting system through the integration of the recently introduced Gradle Problems API. As an engineer who uses tools like Detekt and Ktlint daily, I wanted the opportunity to contribute to these popular tools to enhance their usefulness. This past summer I was also exploring how to make a linter or a plugin, so this project also gave me more insight into that.\n\nGSoC experience\n\nI discovered GSoC a couple years ago when my previous mentor mentioned it when I was looking for summer internships and did not have any luck elsewhere. Unfortunately the deadline to apply to be a contributor had passed at that time, but I kept it in my back pocket to apply for in the future.\n\nSince I am a full-time Android Engineer, I wanted to contribute to the Kotlin Foundation, as that is the language we use to develop our Android app. I wrote the proposal and met with the potential mentors to talk more about implementation and my goals for the project. To my surprise, my proposal was accepted!\n\nNow, of course, I encountered challenges along the way. Learning about plugins took extra time, having a full-time job when we were coming out with big and new feature releases that I was leading did not help, and a small but noticeable one was the time difference between me and my mentors. The last one wasn’t too bad, but when things started to pile up at work or when I had to prepare for my conference talks, it did take my focus away from this project.\n\nSome takeaways are that I learned more about how plugins work, learned about open source, and connected with people that I would normally not have the chance to. I am still interested in open-source projects, but not necessarily plugin development. Nonetheless I enjoyed participating in the project and have a couple PRs that I need to fix up before they can be merged. You can find the project page here, which also has the linked PRs. Collaboration, communication, and more Kotlin, of course, were skills I practiced during this project, which I am grateful for since they all contribute to becoming a better and more well-rounded engineer.\n\nParticipating was a rewarding experience, and it opened up my eyes to the open-source community. To anyone considering GSoC, especially beginners, I would say to apply! It is very beginner-friendly, and you can acquire valuable skills that you would not easily gain elsewhere. Below are some links where you can find me and my work! Thanks for reading about my GSoC journey.\n\nResources and contacts\n\nYou can see what other things I am working on or have done thus far on my website, where you can also find links to my most recent talks if you are interested! I also have a newsletter that I try to stay consistent with, which is about mobile application development and any projects or conferences I have in flight.

Her project tackled Configuration Cache compatibility across major community plugins, refactoring them to remove bottlenecks and enable smarter caching. She contributed fixes, documentation, and patterns now adopted across plugins, boosting performance for developers everywhere. Project page\n\nMentors: Oleg Nenashev (ex-Gradle), Rafael Chaves (Gradle), Rodrigo Oliveira (Gradle)\n\nAbout the author\n\nHi everyone! I'm Nouran Atef, a senior computer engineering student from Cairo, Egypt. I'm passionate about developer tooling and open-source collaboration, and I love diving deep into build systems to make development faster and more efficient for everyone.\n\nWhy this project matters\n\nWe've all been there: You make a tiny change, hit \"build,\" and then wait... and wait. In large-scale projects, slow build times are a major drain on productivity. This is the exact problem my Google Summer of Code project with the Kotlin Foundation aimed to tackle.\n\nThe goal was to improve support for Gradle’s Configuration Cache, a powerful feature that dramatically speeds up builds by caching the result of the configuration phase. When a plugin isn't compatible, the entire cache is invalidated, and the performance gains are lost. My project focused on identifying popular community plugins with these compatibility issues, fixing them, and contributing those fixes back to the open-source community.\n\nBy making more plugins compatible, we make Gradle builds faster and more reliable, which is a huge win for developer productivity and CI stability across the Gradle plugins.\n\nTechnical highlights\n\nThe primary technical challenge encountered was that plugins were accessing the live, non-serializable Project object during task execution, which is incompatible with the Configuration Cache.\n\nTo solve this, I used a consistent strategy across several plugins: decouple tasks from the live project model. This meant reading all the necessary data during the configuration phase and passing it to the task in a safe, serializable way.\n\nMy main tools for this were:\n\nSerializable data transfer objects (DTOs): I created simple data-holder classes to act as a \"snapshot\" of the required project information. Gradle’s lazy Provider API: I used Provider<T> to represent values that might not be known at configuration time, deferring their computation until they were actually needed. This allowed me to safely connect data from the plugin extension to the task inputs, ensuring proper task dependency tracking and configuration cache compatibility.\nA few key contributions\n\nWhile I worked on several plugins, here are a few highlights:\n\n1. Nebula Gradle Lint Plugin (gradle-lint-plugin)\nProblem: The plugin's primary violation was its direct reference to the Project object and its use of project.configurations to resolve dependencies at configuration time. The direct Project reference has been successfully removed. Fix: The core approach was to decouple tasks and services from Gradle's live Project object. This was achieved through a consistent, two-pattern strategy:\nOperate on data snapshots: I created simple, serializable data containers (ProjectInfo and ProjectTree) to act as a \"snapshot\" of the necessary data, extracted using Gradle's lazy Provider API. Defer access with a supplier: For rare cases where a task absolutely required the live Project model at execution time, I used the serializable Supplier. This provides a \"recipe\" to get the Project object on demand, isolating the non-cache-friendly logic.\nTechnical write-up: Supporting Configuration Cache - my learnings from the Nebula Lint Plugin. Pull request: #433\n2. Liquibase Gradle Plugin (liquibase-gradle-plugin)\nProblem: The main task accessed project.properties, project.getProjectDir(), and other Project APIs directly during execution. Fix: I introduced two DTOs, LiquibaseInfo and ProjectInfo, to capture all the necessary data at configuration time. The task was then refactored to operate on these DTOs, making its execution logic stateless and cache-friendly. Pull request: #176 Bonus: This work was turned into a guide for the official Gradle Cookbook: Case Study - Enabling Gradle Configuration Cache Support in the Liquibase Plugin.\n3. Compose Multiplatform Localization Plugin\nProblem: The plugin's main task contained multiple Configuration Cache violations by accessing the Project object during the execution phase. Specifically, it used project.projectDir to resolve file paths and project.logger for logging messages. Fix: This was a more straightforward fix. I replaced the project.projectDir call with a lazy @Internal property and switched from project.logger to the task's own built-in getLogger() method. Pull requests: #12 and #13\nAbout My GSoC Experience\n\nI discovered GSoC while looking for ways to contribute to impactful open-source projects. The idea of working on developer tools that I use every day was incredibly exciting. I spent a lot of time studying Gradle's build lifecycle and the Configuration Cache documentation to write a proposal that outlined a clear, actionable plan for identifying and fixing issues in community plugins.\n\nWorking with my mentors, Rafael Chaves, Rodrigo Oliveira, and Oleg Nenashev, was an amazing experience. They provided invaluable guidance, from high-level architectural advice to detailed feedback on pull requests. Their expertise helped me navigate the complexities of both Gradle and the various open-source projects I contributed to.\n\nThe biggest challenge was the variety of plugin architectures. Each one required a unique approach, and some required deep architectural changes. It was a fantastic learning opportunity.\n\nThrough GSoC, I've learned so much:\n\nTechnical skills: I gained deep knowledge of the Gradle API, build performance optimization, and advanced debugging techniques. Tools: I became much more proficient with Git and GitHub Actions. Mindset: I learned the art of open-source collaboration, how to communicate effectively with maintainers, respond to feedback, and patiently work to get contributions merged.\n\nThis experience has solidified my passion for working on developer productivity tools. My plan is to stay active in the Gradle community, continue supporting my open PRs, and find new plugins to improve.\n\nDemos\nMidterm demo: This video demonstrates the progress made during the first half of the project, showcasing the initial fixes and the overall approach to making community plugins compatible with Gradle's Configuration Cache.\nGSoC 2025- Nouran- Improving Configuration Cache and lock contention in key Gradle plugins\nFinal evaluation: This video covers the full scope of the project, including all completed deliverables and future plans.\nGSoC 2025 Final Presentation\nResources\nMy GSoC project page: Improving Configuration Cache in key Gradle plugins My technical blog post: Supporting Configuration Cache - my learnings from the Nebula Lint Plugin Gradle Cookbook guide: Example - Configuration Cache compatibility for the Liquibase plugin Community tracking issue: List of Community Plugins with Configuration Cache Issues\nFind me online\n\nI'm always happy to connect and talk about build systems, open source, or anything in between!\n\nGitHub: @Nouran-11 LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/nouran-atef11","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2025-gradle-cache/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 19, 2025","title":"Google Summer of Code 2025 – Improving Configuration Cache in Key Gradle Plugins","spoilerSize":null,"coverImage":{"publicURL":"/static/db4d30794f785472938a00ace065c7ff/gsoc-2025.png"}}},{"id":"62acebc1-69fb-504a-ab1b-432a1f7b020f","excerpt":"As one of the first Firebase libraries with native Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) support, Sean’s project bridges Android and iOS with a shared Gemini-powered Firebase AI layer.

The Gradle Convention Plugin introduces a clean, Kotlin-first way to build, test, and publish Jenkins plugins, standardizing best practices, automating checks, and bringing long-requested Gradle parity to the community.\n\nProject page\n\nMentors: Oleg Nenashev (ex-Gradle), Rahul Somasunderam (Netflix), Steve Hill (Netflix)\n\nIntroduction\n\nHello everyone 👋, I’m Aarav Mahajan, a computer engineering student at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology in Patiala, Punjab, India. This year, I had the incredible opportunity to work on a Kotlin Foundation project for Google Summer of Code 2025, contributing under the Jenkins organisation on the Gradle Convention Plugin project – an experience that blended my love for Kotlin, DevOps, and developer tooling.\n\nThe moment that acceptance email from Google landed in my inbox, I couldn’t stop smiling. I knew right then that my summer was about to be filled with code, learning, and a lot of open-source magic. 😊\n\nProject overview\n\nWhile most of the Java and Kotlin ecosystem has embraced modern build tools like Gradle, with its fast builds and elegant Kotlin DSL, Jenkins plugin developers have largely remained tied to Apache Maven. It remains the primary and officially recommended build tool for Jenkins plugin development, powering the vast majority of plugins in the ecosystem. Its strong integration with the Jenkins plugin parent POM, extensive documentation, and mature lifecycle support make it the safest and default choice for most developers.\n\nGradle support technically existed through the Gradle JPI plugin, but it came with major limitations: no native PCT support, fragile dependency management, and missing compliance for Jenkins hosting. In late 2022, the Jenkins community opened a discussion highlighting significant gaps in Gradle support for plugin hosting and automation. During that time, new open-source Jenkins plugins using Gradle were temporarily blocked from hosting until those issues were resolved.\n\nThe Jenkins Gradle Convention Plugin, developed as part of my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025, offers a standardized solution for building Jenkins plugins with Gradle. This initiative arose from community discussions and efforts to address existing gaps. I built this plugin in collaboration with Gradle, Netflix, and the Kotlin Foundation, under the expert guidance of Oleg Nenashev, Steve Hill, and Rahul Somasunderam.\n\nIt is a Kotlin-first Gradle convention plugin that acts as the Maven parent POM equivalent for Jenkins plugin development with Gradle. Built on top of the well-established Gradle JPI plugin, it provides a unified, opinionated foundation for building, testing, and publishing Jenkins plugins – standardizing best practices, automating quality checks, and eliminating boilerplate. It is an important step toward making Gradle a first-class citizen in Jenkins plugin development, closing long-standing gaps identified in prior community discussions.\n\nThis plugin also showcases how Kotlin’s expressive DSL and strong type-safety simplify complex Gradle build logic, turning repetitive scripts into clean, reliable configurations. It also highlights Kotlin’s versatility – not just for building applications, but for building the infrastructure that powers them.\n\nMy GSoC journey with the Kotlin Foundation\nThe search that led me here\n\nGoogle Summer of Code (GSoC) has always been more than just a program – it’s where curiosity meets real-world contribution, and a dream opportunity for every tech enthusiast. Each GSoC season, I’d read about developers who started as users and went on to contribute to the tools they used on a daily basis. Every one of those stories left a spark in me – a quiet sense of inspiration and determination that someday, I would be part of that journey too.\n\nSo, as I was scrolling through this year’s organizations and project ideas, a Google Discover notification popped up on my phone: “The Kotlin Foundation joins GSoC 2025.” I paused for a moment – and honestly, my eyes lit up. Kotlin had been such a big part of my journey as a developer; the idea of contributing back to its ecosystem felt right. It wasn’t just excitement; it was an unmistakable feeling of “this is where I’m meant to be.” From that very moment, I knew I had found the organization I wanted to be part of.\n\nThe next phase was project selection. I scanned through a broad range of projects across build systems, developer tooling, and multiplatform support. The “Jenkins Plugins Toolchain / Gradle Convention Plugin” idea jumped out. It brought together everything I love – automation, Gradle, and the Kotlin ecosystem – with a clear goal of simplifying plugin development through consistency and convention.\n\nWriting the proposal\n\nCrafting the proposal turned out to be an intense but deeply rewarding process. I spent a week diving deep into the pain points of Jenkins plugin development, studying how the existing Gradle JPI plugin worked and where it fell short, and going through the community discussions to understand what developers struggled with the most. My goal wasn’t just to offer quick patches/fixes, but to design and implement a solution that genuinely enhanced the developer experience.\n\nOnce I felt confident about the direction, I began writing the proposal – gathering resources, watching talks on Gradle plugin development, exploring Jenkins repositories, and falling down more than one rabbit hole along the way. I built a small prototype to enhance my understanding and showcase the idea in action. After drafting my initial proposal, I shared it with Oleg, the organization admin, who gave me insightful feedback. Shortly after, Oleg scheduled a quick virtual coffee chat, where we discussed the project, my motivations, and how the idea could evolve during GSoC. That conversation gave me a clearer vision of what lay ahead and transformed my excitement into genuine momentum.\n\nThe selection moment\n\nWhen the results were announced, I remember refreshing my inbox late at night – heart racing – and there it was: “Congratulations!” I had been selected. That single word felt like the reward for weeks of effort, late nights, and hard work. I couldn’t help but smile, and the first thing I did was tell my family – they were just as excited as I was.\n\nCommunity bonding\n\nThe Community Bonding Phase that followed next kicked things off with introductions, aligned goals and expectations, and set up communication channels to keep the project on track. I spent time configuring my development environment and exploring the Jenkins plugin ecosystem more deeply.\n\nFirst Coding Phase: Laying the foundation\n\nOnce the community bonding period ended, it was time to roll up my sleeves and dive into the code. The first few weeks were all about understanding how the Jenkins plugin ecosystem worked in practice, experimenting, breaking things, and learning fast. My primary focus was simplifying dependency management with the Jenkins Bill of Materials (BOM) and wiring up the basic Gradle conventions. I added support for code-quality tools like Checkstyle, SpotBugs, Detekt, etc., making plugin builds cleaner and more reliable by default. I began testing the convention plugin on several Jenkins plugins already built with Gradle to see how it performed in real-world scenarios. That phase gave me confidence that this project wasn’t just an experiment anymore; it was becoming something developers could truly depend on.\n\nMid-term evaluation: Building momentum\n\nBy mid-term evaluation, I had to demonstrate working BOM integration, quality tool setup, and working examples. The pressure was real, but passing that evaluation with positive feedback from my mentors was one of the proudest and most fun moments of my summer.\n\nHere is my demo from the mid-term evaluation: Google Drive Link.\n\nFinal Coding Phase: Bringing it all together\n\nEverything came together in the last stretch. I concentrated on enhancing support for Plugin Compatibility Tester (PCT), streamlining metadata production, and getting the plugin ready for public release. It seemed like a full-circle moment to submit the plugin hosting request and have it approved by the official Jenkins organisation. Writing a community blog post, documenting the plugin, and getting early feedback from developers who were testing it out were how I ended the summer.\n\nWorking with my mentors\n\nI would say this was one of the most rewarding parts of this journey. Oleg, Steve, and Rahul weren’t just reviewers; they were guides who challenged my assumptions, encouraged experimentation, and shared insights from real-world experience. Our discussions often went beyond the project itself, touching on design philosophy, long-term maintainability, and open-source collaboration. The feedback that they provided shaped not just my code, but my approach to problem-solving. This taught me more about modern software engineering than any textbook could.\n\nChallenges along the way\n\nThe steep learning curve of understanding Jenkins’ plugin architecture, coupled with Gradle’s evolving APIs, tested my patience and adaptability. Some days, I spent long hours debugging tricky build issues, ensuring cross-version compatibility, meeting Jenkins hosting requirements, wiring up code-quality tools, and refining every small piece until the build felt truly production-ready. Integrating the Jenkins BOM and Plugin Compatibility Tester (PCT) added another layer of complexity, as I had to ensure the plugin worked seamlessly across multiple Jenkins core and dependency versions. Every roadblock taught me something. I learnt how to break down complex problems…","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2025-gradle-plugin-jenkins/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 19, 2025","title":"Google Summer of Code 2025 – Gradle Convention Plugin for Developing Jenkins Plugins","spoilerSize":null,"coverImage":{"publicURL":"/static/db4d30794f785472938a00ace065c7ff/gsoc-2025.png"}}},{"id":"de5c8482-b416-5e13-8f47-06354ea68e48","excerpt":"From picking up Kotlin from scratch to building a compiler-integrated Language Server with the new Analysis API, Hemram’s project expanded the boundaries of Kotlin tooling. Working with mentors from Uber and the Kotlin Foundation, he delivered a modern, open foundation for editor integrations and future AI-assisted tools for the Kotlin Language Server Protocol.\n\nProject page\n\nMentors: Shauvik Roy Choudhary, Ryan U, Michael Noah, Claudia Babescu (all from Uber)\n\nAbout the author\n\nHi, I’m Hemram, a developer from Bangalore, India, passionate about developer tooling and compiler technologies.\n\nIntro and motivation\n\nI’ve always been curious about how Language Server Protocols (LSPs) work behind the scenes. When I came across this project idea during Google Summer of Code 2025, it immediately caught my interest.\n\nDuring that time, I was exploring kotlin-language-server, which is an open-source Kotlin LSP using kotlinc under the hood. I had experienced some bottlenecks and understood what the community wanted. On researching further, I found out about the Kotlin Analysis API, which is a better way to communicate with the K2 compiler compared to the inefficient kotlinc. This formed the base of my proposal for this LSP project.\n\nTechnical Highlights\n\nThe project involved designing a new Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation based on version 3.17 of the spec.\n\nKey components:\nKotlin Analysis API – leveraged for semantic analysis and compiler-backed insights. LSP4J – the Java framework used for implementing the LSP specification. RocksDB – integrated as a persistent key-value store for efficient codebase indexing and symbol resolution.\nCore features implemented:\nProject handling for the Gradle build system (single and multi-module for both Vanilla and Android) Go to Definition Go to Implementation Go to Reference Rename refactoring Document symbols Semantic highlighting Hover (with KDoc and JavaDoc-based descriptions). Generic, import, and package-based code completion.\n\nRoadMap\n\nHigh-level overview\nAbout my GSoC experience\n\nIt was an exciting period working under the Kotlin Foundation, building a Kotlin language server.\n\nI first heard about GSoC a few years ago and always admired how contributors made a real impact in open-source ecosystems. This year, I finally took the leap, and it’s been a rewarding experience from start to finish.\n\nThere were some challenges along the way, like when the official Kotlin LSP was announced at KotlinConf 2025. As it was in the pre-alpha stage, I had to fork an incomplete project and contribute to GSoC on the basis of that. Beyond that, the journey was pretty smooth, with the completion of the Kotlin LSP as an MVP.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nAs it was the starting point of my open-source journey, I learned about how real collaboration happens, from writing clear commits and discussing design choices to adapting when project goals shift.\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways from my GSoC journey was stepping out of my comfort zone and realizing how much it stretched my learning curve. I had to pick up Kotlin from scratch, explore the Analysis API, and work across multiple tools and environments. It was also incredibly rewarding to see my work tested, reviewed, and used by others in the community.\n\nResources\nProject Page GitHub Repo\nContacts\nLinkedIn GitHub Email: kuheram777@gmail.com","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2025-kotlin-lps/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"November 19, 2025","title":"Google Summer of Code 2025 – Build a Modern, Compiler-Integrated Kotlin Language Server","spoilerSize":null,"coverImage":{"publicURL":"/static/db4d30794f785472938a00ace065c7ff/gsoc-2025.png"}}},{"id":"a633286e-8d0b-5d46-a072-cd0b4720768b","excerpt":"We’re excited to welcome Sergei Rybalkin, Senior Staff Software Engineer at Meta, as the newest member of the Kotlin Foundation Board.

You are the ones who create all of those new things to make the world better. To do that effectively, you need tools to rely on that are powerful yet easy to use. That’s why Kotlin was created. But the language is only a part of the story – you need an entire ecosystem to make things actually work together. That includes various developer tools and, among others, a build system, and an IDE.\n\nFor Kotlin projects, the Gradle Build Tool, also known as Gradle, is often the build system of choice. Gradle, as a powerful and flexible build system, has become a key part of many development processes. Nowadays it is at the core of many server-side, frontend, and mobile projects. It is also the default build system for Android projects.\n\nHowever, great flexibility comes with challenges. Complexity, a steep learning curve, and friction between the IDE, language, and build system can make everyday development harder than it should be. These are not just technical hurdles – they affect your productivity, creativity, and satisfaction. At Google, Gradle, and JetBrains, we recognize this and want to deliver the best possible developer experience. Hence, even before the Kotlin Foundation was created, we worked closely on key ecosystem components and their integrations.\n\nSeveral parties are involved, each playing a unique role in the developer ecosystem:\n\nJetBrains creates the IntelliJ Platform, the foundation for many IDEs, including Google's Android Studio. JetBrains also develops Kotlin, which is the language of choice for Android and also targets multiple other platforms. Google extends the IntelliJ Platform into Android Studio and develops multiple other tools and technologies, tailoring them to the needs of mobile and cloud developers. Gradle powers the build processes that bring your code to life, enabling smooth workflows for testing, packaging, and deployment.\n\nOur tools are deeply interconnected, and the quality of the developer experience depends on how well they work together. By aligning our efforts, we can solve shared problems more effectively and deliver a seamless experience across the entire development stack.\n\nThat’s why JetBrains, Gradle, and Google have joined forces to address these challenges head-on: to simplify configuration, minimize friction between the parts involved, and make development more enjoyable. By working together, we’re not just aiming for incremental fixes – we’re rethinking how our tools interact to create a smoother, faster, and more intuitive experience for developers everywhere.\n\nJoining forces means bringing together feedback and knowledge about user needs. While our audiences intersect, each company still gets unique feedback, so combining our perspectives allows us to see the bigger picture in the industry. Our expertise in specific areas allows us to come up with different ideas and make sure our efforts are aligned and address user needs.\n\nCollaboration in action\n\nThis partnership isn’t just theoretical – it’s a hands-on collaboration.\n\nWe established regular syncs to discuss technical challenges, from build performance to IDE integration and simple bugs. We share knowledge about developer pain points, prioritize solutions, and align on the best approaches. For the last three years, we’ve brought our teams together for intensive, in-person annual summits. These gatherings are opportunities to brainstorm, prototype solutions, reflect on progress, and plan the future of the involved ecosystems, such as Android, Kotlin, Gradle, and software development in general. Beyond technical fixes, we’re aligning on ways to improve the user experience across all of our tools, making sure developers spend less time struggling with configuration and more time building.\n\nThis collaboration is already delivering real results, including:\n\nKotlin DSL as the default for new builds in the Gradle Build Tool since 2023. Better IDE Integration – Gradle sync in IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio has become faster and more reliable, with clearer feedback when something goes wrong. With the upcoming configuration cache and Isolated Projects, we anticipate further speed increases for end users. Declarative Gradle initiative – A shift towards simpler, more readable, developer-first build configurations that reduce complexity and improve maintainability. Gradle Daemon toolchain support – A common way to define the JVM for the Gradle Daemon and make sure it always starts and does so with the same JVM. Project isolation initiative, which is bringing significant performance gains for large projects, thanks to Gradle’s improvements in isolating subprojects and optimizing caching. A lot of other small Improvements, from better error messaging to faster default configurations. Various ecosystem and educational programs to gather more feedback and share best practices, driven or developed by the Kotlin Foundation committees.\n\nThere are other things in the works which we expect to bring a lot of value for developers. Stay tuned for more announcements!\n\nAreas of focus\n\nWhile we’re proud of what we’ve achieved, there are a lot of things to work on. The priorities for future improvements include:\n\nThe in-IDE experience – Making Gradle and Kotlin integrations seamless, responsive, and intuitive within IDEs. Performance – Reducing sync and build times and ensuring smooth scalability for large, complex projects. Clarity – Simplifying configurations, improving error messaging, providing help, and making tools easier to use.\nWe’re listening: Your feedback matters\n\nEverything we do is based on user the needs and pain points we recognize. The source of this knowledge is your feedback, so please keep it coming! We are listening!\n\nWhether through surveys, issue trackers, or community discussions, we want to hear from you. What’s working? What isn’t? Where can the experience be improved?\n\nWe encourage you to keep sharing your thoughts, ideas, and experiences with us whenever you want.

This project brought Android project support to the Gradle Build Server. Despite starting with limited Gradle API knowledge, contributor Tanish Ranjan successfully implemented features like composite build support, Java Home handling, and Android project discovery. These enhancements have been integrated into production, enriching Gradle for Kotlin/Android development.\n\nWe thank Tanish Ranjan and the team of mentors from Gradle and Microsoft – Oleg Nenashev, Donát Csikós, Bálint Hegyi, Sheng Chen, and Reinhold – for their valuable contributions to the Kotlin and Gradle ecosystems.\n\nCheck out the project page.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHi everyone, my name is Tanish Ranjan, and last year I participated in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2024. I had the amazing opportunity to collaborate with folks from Gradle, Microsoft, and Google to bring Android support to the Gradle Build Server, under the umbrella of the Kotlin Foundation.\n\nToday, I’m excited to share my journey – from finding out about GSoC to completing my project. If you’re considering applying for GSoC or just curious about the experience, hopefully my story will give you some insights!\n\nHow I discovered GSoC (Spoiler: it was last minute!)\n\nI’ll be honest – I had no idea what GSoC was until a friend casually mentioned it to me during a phone call. The kicker? This was just a week before the contributor application was set to open!\n\nWithin that week, I dove deep into learning about GSoC – the fantastic learning experiences and career opportunities it offers. Pretty quickly, I made up my mind to get involved. I started browsing through the list of registered organizations, hoping to find a project related to Android development, since that’s where my skills were strongest.\n\nA LinkedIn post caught my attention – Android developers were talking about how the Kotlin Foundation was one of the organizations participating in GSoC. After going through Kotlin Foundation’s project ideas, one grabbed my attention: adding Android support to the Gradle Build Server. It sounded challenging and aligned perfectly with my skills, so I decided to go for it.\n\nCrafting my proposal (And why it took multiple attempts)\n\nWhen the Contributor Application Phase began, contributors could send in up to three proposals, but I chose to focus all my energy on just one: the project with the Kotlin Foundation.\n\nAt this point, I reached out to the organization admin, which turned out to be a game-changer. They reviewed our proposals, offering feedback on what was missing. One of the most common mistakes (including mine!) was not specifying clear deliverables. Everyone wrote about themselves and the project they wanted to contribute to, but we weren’t clear about what we’d actually deliver.\n\nI had to revise my proposal twice before I was happy with it. Finally, I submitted it.\n\nThe moment of truth: Getting accepted\n\nOn May 1, 2024, the accepted contributors were announced. I remember that night clearly. I was working on a freelance project when I received an email at around 11:30 pm with the subject: “Congratulations, your proposal with Kotlin Foundation has been accepted!”\n\nI couldn’t contain my excitement – I was literally bursting with joy! Having just graduated high school in 2023 and not started university yet, the opportunity to work with industry professionals from Google, Microsoft and Gradle felt surreal.\n\nWith my proposal accepted, I dove into researching technologies I’d need for the project, such as JSON-RPC and Build Server Protocol (BSP), while also setting up my work environment.\n\nCommunity Bonding Phase: Meeting the Team\n\nThe first formal step was the Community Bonding Phase. A meeting was organized to introduce all the mentees to the team and admins, where we discussed the projects and how to approach them and set up regular sync-up meetings.\n\nThis phase helped us ease into the collaboration and set the stage for the real coding to begin.\n\nFirst coding phase: Learning Gradle from scratch\n\nWhen the first coding phase started, I was assigned my first task: adding composite build support to the Gradle Build Server. Here’s the catch – I had no prior experience with the Gradle API or the Gradle Tooling API. So far I had only skimmed the tip of the iceberg by using Gradle in building Android projects.\n\nThe first few weeks were tough, as I struggled to get up to speed. But here’s a key lesson I learned: It’s perfectly okay not to know everything at the start. Mentors are there to guide you, but it’s important to do your own research and tackle hurdles first. When you’re stuck, that’s when mentors step in and provide the support you need.\n\nOnce I got comfortable with the technologies and Gradle Build Server project, my work pace picked up. After completing the LanguageExtension downcast fix (which turned out to be a prerequisite for my first task), I tackled the composite builds. This led to my first task being merged just in time for my mid-term evaluation.\n\nMid-term evaluation and a new challenge\n\nA few weeks before the mid-term evaluation, a new task was added to my GSoC project: Android project discovery for the Gradle Build Server. This was a significant addition, but I was excited for the challenge.\n\nWhile the evaluations were being processed, I also started working on Java Home Handling in the Gradle Build Server. Juggling these tasks allowed me to stay ahead and keep making progress.\n\nGradle in Google Summer of Code 2024 - Mid-Term Project Demos\n\nFinal coding phase: Tackling the hardest part\n\nThe final coding phase began with me completing Java Home Handling and submitting a pull request. However, a new update of Gradle for Java extension delayed the PR’s merge. But this delay actually worked in my favor – it gave me time to reconsider our approach to handling Java Home.\n\nOne of my mentors advised against over-engineering the implementation, as it could obscure the logic of Java Home selection and confuse users. Simplifying the approach meant reworking the implementation, but it resulted in a clearer and better experience overall. It was a win-win for the end users.\n\nMy final and most challenging task was adding Android project discovery. This involved working with the AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) API, which had very little documentation on extracting project information for language features.\n\nI reached out to my organization admin, and they connected me with developers from Google who work on AGP. Collaborating with them helped me extract most of the required information. For anything that the AGP API didn’t publicly expose, I found creative workarounds.\n\nBy the end, I successfully added Android project support to the Gradle Build Server! And here’s the most exciting part: every piece of code I wrote was integrated directly into production. Each of my contributions was merged into the next release of the Gradle Build Server, meaning the work I did became part of the official releases of VSCode’s Gradle for Java extension!\n\nWrapping up: Reflections on my GSoC experience\n\nCompleting this project was an incredibly rewarding experience. Not only did I gain technical skills, but I also learned the value of collaboration and communication, and being persistent when tackling challenging tasks.\n\nTo anyone considering GSoC, especially beginners: go for it! Don’t worry if you’re not an expert – this program is all about learning. And trust me, it’ll be one of the most fulfilling experiences of your programming career.\n\nThanks for reading about my GSoC journey.

Thank you to Qizhao Chen and the mentor team from Google and JetBrains – Abduqodiri Qurbonzoda, Dustin Lam, and Rahul Ravikumar – for your great input.\n\nCheck out the kotlinx-benchmark library.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe kotlinx-benchmark library is an open-source tool for benchmarking Kotlin code on various platforms, including the JVM, JS, wasmJs, and native. However, the library lacks support for benchmarking on Android. This project integrated this functionality using the existing Android benchmarking library androidx.benchmark to ensure that the current functionality supports Android as well.\n\nGoals of the project\n\nThe main goals for this project were to:\n\nAutomatically detect Android targets in Kotlin Multiplatform projects and retrieve the corresponding compilation output. Create a template Android project that can be used to run the benchmarks. Retrieve benchmark annotations from the Android target and use the androidx.benchmark library to run these benchmarks in the generated project. Display the benchmark results in the console during execution and write the final results to a file for further analysis.\nAchievements\n\nThe project yielded the following key achievements:\n\nAndroid target detection and compilation output: Implemented detection of Android targets in Kotlin Multiplatform projects and retrieval of the necessary compilation outputs. Template Android project generation: Developed a mechanism to generate a template Android project in the build directory, allowing benchmarks to run seamlessly in an Android environment. Annotation mapping and code generation: Decompiled the compilation output of the Android target and retrieved the annotations with associated data, mapped the annotations to the androidx.benchmark configuration, and generated the necessary benchmark code that can be run by the androidx.benchmark library.

JetBrains, a Kotlin Foundation member, provided mentoring support for this project. This project enhanced the Kotlin-to-Wasm compiler with incremental compilation capabilities, reducing build times by allowing it to recompile only modified files. The contributor, Osama Ahmad, optimized and reused components from the Kotlin/JS backend while improving documentation and refactoring the codebase.\n\nThanks to Osama Ahmad and the mentor from JetBrains, Igor Yakovlev, for their great input!\n\nExplore Kotlin/Wasm.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIncremental compilation is a technique that helps increase compilation speed by recompiling only changed files instead of your whole program (a clean build). The Kotlin-to-Wasm compiler is used to support only clean builds, but during this project, we enhanced it to support incremental compilation, too.\n\nGoals of the project\n\nThe primary goals for the project were:\n\nTo implement incremental compilation for the Wasm backend. To reuse code as much as possible from the JavaScript backend. To specialize and optimize incremental compilation for Wasm.\nAchievements\n\nDuring the project, the following key achievements were made:\n\nIncorporation of incremental compilation: Now, the Wasm backend supports incremental compilation in addition to performing clean builds. Code reuse: Many of the incremental compilation components were reused from the JavaScript backend and are specialized to work with the Wasm backend as well. One example is the CacheUpdater component, which determines the files for which we can use cached compiled files and the files that need to be recompiled, and updates the cached files as appropriate. Optimizations: Multiple optimizations have been tried. Some are not worth the complexity they’ll introduce, such as trying to resolve struct field IDs in link time, but some have been successfully applied, such as the relocation of most bodiless declarations before starting the compilation process. Documentation and refactoring: As a side effect of incorporating incremental compilation, the codebase became more complex and needed some refactoring and documentation for easier future development. One example is breaking the final linking function, linkWasmCompiledFragments, into multiple smaller and clearer functions, along with the necessary documentation.Newly introduced components such as WasmSerializer and WasmDeserializer are well documented, as well.\nNext steps\n\nThrough benchmarking, we found that the time taken to serialize and deserialize Wasm cached compiled files majorly contributes to linking time. This is because a single Wasm binary is produced, and each time a change is made, we need to load (deserialize) all cached compiled modules and link all of them in a single binary, even if only a single file in a single module was changed.\n\nOne solution to this problem is to implement per-module compilation, in which each Kotlin module is compiled to a standalone Wasm binary, and utilize Wasm features to link between the different module Wasm binaries. This way, we don’t need to load every module and link all of them into a single binary on each recompilation.","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2024-wasm-incremental-compilation/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 21, 2025","title":"Google Summer of Code 2024 – Incremental Compilation for the Kotlin/Wasm Compiler","spoilerSize":null,"coverImage":{"publicURL":"/static/40e346b13f8589ca2ac5293e4c79a24f/cover.png"}}},{"id":"42465459-0101-5284-81a3-e9f834deaabc","excerpt":"The Kotlin Foundation facilitated mentorship for several projects during the Google Summer of Code 2024, and we are excited to announce the completion of a project for a composable functions gallery generator! WhiteScent, a part-time computer science student and Android enthusiast, contributed to this project, and Artem Kobzar, a software engineer working on Kotlin/Wasm at JetBrains, served as the mentor.\n\nThe project aimed to develop a Gradle Plugin and runtime library to describe and generate a multiplatform (web, desktop, iOS, and Android) gallery app that shows all of the described composable functions individually in a single location.\n\nExplore Storytale on GitHub.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the beginning of the React era of web development, Storybook’s proposed approach of describing component states and generating the whole UI library gallery is still one of the most common approaches to documentation in web development.\n\nJetpack Compose, the declarative UI framework developed by Google, has advanced rapidly, and JetBrains has extended this technology across multiple platforms. The result is Compose Multiplatform, a framework for sharing UIs across Android, iOS, web, and desktop.\n\nWith Compose UI, you can easily write components for your multiplatform apps. But what if you could visually integrate the components you’ve written into one place?\n\nThat's exactly what our project Storytale aims to accomplish.\n\nProject goals\n\nFirst, we plan to create a Compose Multiplatform app that can showcase all of the created components. Leveraging the power of the multiplatform technology, you'll be able to seamlessly view your components across various platforms.\n\nTo achieve this, we will:\n\nDevelop a Gradle plugin that provides separate source sets and tasks for generating the gallery. Build a runtime library to describe the different states of composable functions. Create a multiplatform UI that is available for all of the platforms.\n\nWe will also provide developers with a set of runtime APIs and Gradle tasks, which will help simplify the process of writing components that need visualization in your projects.\n\nLet's write a simple use case, assuming we have a PrimaryButton component.\n\n@Composable  \nfun PrimaryButton(  \n  text: String,  \n  onClick: () -> Unit = {},  \n  enabled: Boolean = true  \n) {  \n Button(onClick = onClick, enabled = enabled) {  \n   Text(text)\n }  \n}\n\n\nIn the project, we can create a commonStories folder and then write the following code:\n\nval PrimaryButton by story {  \n  val enabled by parameter(true)  \n  val text by parameter(\"Click Me\")\n\n  PrimaryButton(text = text, enabled = enabled)  \n}\n\n\nThen, depending on the target platform, we can run the storiesRun command, and we'll be able to see this visualized component on the corresponding platform. We'll also be able to edit PrimaryButton's text and enabled parameters. That's it!\n\nHere is a demo of the generated gallery for an example project working on Android, iOS, and desktop: https://youtu.be/9IYsHYakMuM\n\nThe source code of the described stories is here.\n\nNext steps\n\nWe've experimented with the feasibility of many aspects in this project, and so far the results look promising! Here are the future improvements we are planning to make:\n\nExtending the runtime API to describe enums and modifiers and to provide variation themes. Integrating Dokka documentation into the Composable function stories. Implementing an IntelliJ IDEA plugin to support an @Preview-like experience for a single story.\n\nThanks to WhiteScent and Artem Kobzar for creating this tool and making the Compose Multiplatform tools ecosystem even richer!\n\nFeel free to share your ideas and contributions to our project: Storytale on GitHub!","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2024-storytale/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 21, 2025","title":"Google Summer of Code 2024 – Storytale Compose Multiplatform Component Gallery Generator","spoilerSize":null,"coverImage":{"publicURL":"/static/40e346b13f8589ca2ac5293e4c79a24f/cover.png"}}},{"id":"b9331e31-2aa5-5934-a086-d86e070bc413","excerpt":"The Kotlin Foundation’s Ecosystem Committee is happy to name the winners of the second round of our grants program!

JetBrains, a Kotlin Foundation member, provided mentoring support for this project. The contributor to this project was Henok Woldesenbet, an aspiring software engineer and the mentor was Abduqodiri Qurbonzoda, a software developer working on Kotlin libraries at JetBrains. The project aimed to improve the kotlinx-benchmark library API and user experience.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe kotlinx-benchmark library is an invaluable open-source tool that facilitates the benchmarking of multiplatform code written in Kotlin. Despite its essential function, its user experience had some gaps, confusing users and lacking features that developers have come to expect from benchmarking libraries.\n\nGoals\n\nThe primary goals for the project were:\n\nInfuse the library with clear and concise documentation, supplemented with practical usage examples. The absence of comprehensive documentation previously made using kotlinx-benchmark challenging for many, especially newcomers. Address user concerns and lint the library API, making it more intuitive and user friendly. Refine the library's internals, including by enhancing integration tests, improving error feedback through refined validations and task descriptions, and streamlining the profiler's execution process. Elevate the overall user experience, transforming the kotlinx-benchmark from a budding tool into a robust library that the Kotlin community can rely on.\nAchievements\n\nHere are the primary achievements made in the Google Summer of Code project:\n\nDocumentation for increased accessibility: Detailed documentation was added, ensuring that anyone, from novices to experts, could dive into, experiment with, and harness the power of the library. Improved error messages: A library's UX is significantly influenced by the quality of its error feedback. Error messages were revamped, ensuring they are not only accurate but also instructive, guiding users towards solutions. Refined integration tests: Comprehensive integration tests were added to ensure stability across a variety of use cases. Tech stack modernization: The library was migrated to the latest versions of Gradle and JMH, and transitioned from Groovy DSL to the latest version of Kotlin DSL to optimize the build scripts. Streamlined profiler usage: In response to feedback from our users, the process of running profilers was simplified, facilitating a smoother user experience.\nNext Steps\n\nTo further enhance kotlinx-benchmark, we are planning to:\n\nSupport the Android target and integrate the androidx.benchmark framework into kotlinx-benchmark. Implement an IntelliJ IDEA plugin to support running benchmarks with a click of a run button, the same way as running unit tests.\n\nIf you'd like to help continue improving kotlinx-benchmark, check out the open issues for ideas on where to jump in.\n\nThank you Henok and Abduqodiri for making kotlinx-benchmark even better for Kotlin developers!","fields":{"slug":"/news/gsoc-2023-kotlinx-benchmark/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"January 09, 2024","title":"Google Summer of Code 2023 – Enhancing kotlinx-benchmark's API and User Experience","spoilerSize":null,"coverImage":null}},{"id":"49ba8d96-e4cf-5117-b5f0-b88f14120e7b","excerpt":"The Kotlin Foundation sponsored four projects for Google Summer of Code 2023, and we are excited to announce the completion of the Parallel Stacks for Kotlin Coroutines in the Debugger project, for which Google, a Kotlin Foundation member, provided mentoring support. Today we'd like to share the details of the project with you. The primary contributor to this project was Raehat Singh Nanda, a computer science undergraduate, mentored by Nikita Nazarov, Kotlin Compiler Engineer on the Android team at Google. The project aimed to provide a visual way to debug applications using multiple coroutines.\n\nProject Goals\n\nWhile coroutines streamline asynchronous coding, debugging multiple coroutines can pose challenges, especially in large-scale applications. IntelliJ IDEA's Coroutines tab provides the ability to visualize coroutines, but it doesn't provide functionality to understand the connections between different but related coroutines.\n\nThe new Coroutine Stacks IntelliJ IDEA plugin provides a graphical depiction of numerous coroutines in specific application states. This innovation draws inspiration from the Parallel Stacks feature found in established IDEs such as JetBrains Rider, JetBrains CLion, and Microsoft Visual Studio.\n\nUpon initiating the IntelliJ IDEA debugger and encountering a breakpoint, an application enters a suspended state. Then, the Coroutine Stacks panel displays a parallel stack view that facilitates in-depth analysis for debugging purposes.\n\nCoroutine Stacks\n\nConsider the following code sample with multiple coroutines:\n\nimport kotlinx.coroutines.*\n\nfun main() = runBlocking<Unit> {\n    launch {\n        withContext(Dispatchers.Default) {\n            println()\n            delay(1000)\n        }\n    }\n    \n    \n    launch {\n        withContext(Dispatchers.Default) {\n            println()\n            delay(1000)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nLet’s add a breakpoint on the following line:\n\nTo open the Coroutine Stacks panel, click in the bottom right-hand corner of your main IDE panel:\n\nAfter the debugger stops at the breakpoint and opens the panel, you will see something like this:\n\nThe Coroutine Stacks panel shows a graphical representation of different stack traces from different coroutines.\n\nFrom the image above, it is clear that there are two coroutines in the application. Their stack traces share a number of frames up until resumeWith. After that, the control flow of these coroutines diverges. The stack trace with the blue border refers to the coroutine that contains the current breakpoint. The frames highlighted in yellow come from libraries. You can hide library frames by clicking the filter button:\n\nNow you can see that the stack traces of the two running coroutines only have library frames in common.\n\nIn the example, all coroutines are running on the same dispatcher, but you can switch the dispatcher by using the dropdown menu at the top of the panel:\n\nUse the minus button to zoom out. You can return to normal size by clicking the plus or the 1:1 button:\n\nYou can also add coroutine creation frames by clicking this button:\n\nThe creation frames are highlighted in blue. For more complex examples, the coroutine trace graph can change dramatically after the creation frames are added.\n\nClick the photo button to capture a coroutine dump:\n\nYou can click on the frames to navigate to the corresponding source code position:\n\nInstallation\n\nGo to Settings / Preferences | Plugins in IntelliJ IDEA.\n\nSwitch to Marketplace and search for Coroutine Stacks:\n\nSelect the plugin and click Install.\n\nAfter the installation has been completed, restart the IDE.\n\nFeel Free to Contribute!\n\nThis is just the beginning!

The Ecosystem Committee will play a pivotal role in identifying strategic areas for investment in the Kotlin ecosystem. It will prioritize and recommend direct funding of open-source Kotlin projects and raise awareness of members’ individual efforts in developing and enhancing key libraries.\n\nThe Ecosystem Committee has already contributed to the Foundation’s work by designing and launching the new Grants Program, which supports authors of open-source libraries, tools, and frameworks. As the program supervisor, the committee will review grant applications, evaluate submitted projects, and decide whether each project meets the specific criteria for receiving the grant.\n\nThe new committee will serve as the research arm of the Kotlin Foundation board, assisting in maintaining the Kotlin ecosystem’s growth and sustainability. We are confident it will bring a fresh perspective and help us make informed decisions that will benefit the entire ecosystem.\n\nWe are excited to see the positive impact the Committee’s efforts will have on the Kotlin ecosystem in the near future.\n\nIf you have any questions about the Kotlin Foundation and its work, feel free to get in touch with us in the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel or via email at hello@kotlinfoundation.org.","fields":{"slug":"/news/new-ecosystem-committee/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 25, 2023","title":"The Kotlin Foundation Establishes the New Ecosystem Committee","spoilerSize":450,"coverImage":null}},{"id":"122824ae-b9ae-579e-a905-3911d5c44af4","excerpt":"Today, we’re introducing the Kotlin Foundation's Grants Program! This initiative will be held on a regular basis and provide financial awards to developers who contribute to the Kotlin ecosystem. At the Kotlin Foundation, we understand the effort that goes into maintaining active and valuable libraries, tools, and frameworks. We want to support these contributors, acknowledge their hard work, and encourage them to invest more time and energy into their projects and continue to make a difference. One of the program's essential aspects is that we do not claim any intellectual property rights or trademarks from the authors we support. We believe that contributors should retain ownership of their work.\n\nThe Kotlin Foundation's Ecosystem Committee will oversee the Grants Program. To be considered, projects must meet several requirements. First, the project must be available under a permissive open-source license. This ensures that the project remains accessible to everyone and contributes positively to the Kotlin ecosystem. Second, the project must be actively maintained and have a track record of development history and contributions. Finally, the project should be developed by private individuals. This means contributors are not allowed to develop their projects as part of their usual line of work.\n\nWe encourage you to submit your grant proposals before May 15, 2023. The Ecosystem Committee will evaluate projects based on multiple criteria, including the potential impact on the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, adherence to best practices for library development, and responsiveness to bug reports and security issues.\n\nPlease reach out to us at grants@kotlinfoundation.org or through the #kotlin-foundation Slack channel, where we'd be more than happy to address any of your program-related questions or concerns.
