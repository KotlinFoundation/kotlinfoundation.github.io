We received 59 applications from library project authors across the Kotlin ecosystem. After carefully reviewing all of the entries, we’re excited to introduce the five lucky winners: Konsist – A linter that ensures consistency in Kotlin projects by enforcing a cohesive code structure and unified architecture. The proposal: Add new functionality based on community feedback. Improve architectural assertions to allow more flexible rules. Integrate with the K2 compiler for real-time error and warning notifications in the IDE. Compose Rich Editor – A rich text editor library for Compose Multiplatform, customizable and supporting common rich text editor features. The proposal: Expand platform support and add features like undo/redo and copy/paste for rich text. Achieve API stability and expose useful internal APIs for better control. Build a DSL for rich text creation. Multiplatform Settings – A library for multiplatform apps that enables key-value data persistence in shared code. The proposal: Stabilize experimental coroutines and serialization integrations. Fix crashes related to Keychain usage. Add missing platform implementations. Migrate documentation to a dedicated site and include dokka output. Ultron – A framework for developing UI tests for Android and Compose Multiplatform, built on the Espresso, UI Automator, and Compose UI testing frameworks. The proposal: Stabilize multiplatform support, including enhanced test reporting (Allure integration). Improve Compose UI testing components. Orbit MVI – A simple MVI framework for Kotlin Multiplatform. The proposal: Improve guidance around Multiplatform, including lifecycle management, state persistence, and more. Utilize Kotlin 2.x features. Support desktop platforms. Integrate Compose Multiplatform. Explore JS and WASM compatibility. Add practical examples and tips to the documentation. Implement logging and time travel debugging features.\n\nThese open-source projects truly distinguished themselves with their inspiring ideas, quality of implementation, and alignment with the Grants Program criteria.\n\nEach winner will receive $6,000 to help develop and improve their projects, along with recognition from the Kotlin Foundation.\n\nWe encourage all applicants who did not receive a grant this time to continue developing their projects and keep an eye out for future opportunities. Follow us on our website and social media for updates and the announcement of subsequent rounds of the Grants program.","fields":{"slug":"/news/grants-program-winners-24/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"October 01, 2024","title":"Winners of the Kotlin Foundation Grants Program 2024","spoilerSize":null}},{"id":"342a116e-a27f-5db4-a63d-c0a9d999560f","excerpt":"We are thrilled to announce that Kotzilla has joined the Kotlin Foundation as a Silver member. This new partnership will advance the ecosystem and enrich the Kotlin community. The Kotzilla team has put significant effort into the advancement of Kotlin, especially with the creation of Koin, an open-source dependency injection (DI) framework. Koin helps developers manage their dependencies efficiently, write clean and modular code, as well as develop scalable and maintainable applications. Known for its simplicity and effectiveness, Koin is fully compatible with Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and Compose Multiplatform, enhancing the development of seamless and efficient mobile apps. Currently, Koin is used in over 350,000 mobile applications worldwide and has more than 9 million downloads each month, highlighting its essential role in the Kotlin ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, the Kotzilla team is developing other tools like the Kotzilla Platform that further support the community in creating safer, faster, and more scalable applications.\n\n“Our partnership with the Kotlin Foundation will further propel our mission to make developers' lives easier,” says Arnaud Giuliani, Koin Framework Creator and Lead at Kotzilla.\n\nAs a member of the Kotlin Foundation, Kotzilla will significantly contribute to the Foundation's initiatives, including the grants program for open-source library authors.\n\nTo learn more about the Kotlin Foundation and how members like Kotzilla are contributing to and benefiting from its mission, please visit the membership page. Join us in shaping the future of the Kotlin ecosystem!","fields":{"slug":"/news/kotzilla-joins-kotlin-foundation-silver-member/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 06, 2024","title":"Kotzilla Joins the Kotlin Foundation as a Silver Member","spoilerSize":178}}]}}}
