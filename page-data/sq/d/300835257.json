With Meta joining as a Gold Member, Sergei brings over a decade of hands-on experience in advancing Kotlin across large-scale, production environments.\n\nBefore Meta, Sergei championed Kotlin adoption at Alibaba Group, working on server-side architecture, function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms, and JVM frameworks. He‚Äôs also the author of open-source tools like Kohttp, and a contributor to Redex, Meta‚Äôs Android bytecode optimizer and Buck2, a build tool for large scale code based that supports Kotlin and Android.\n\nA frequent speaker at events like FOSDEM and Kotlin Dev Day, Sergei is known in the community for his practical, performance-focused talks that address real-world challenges in Kotlin development at scale.\n\nHe joins the Foundation at a pivotal moment in our mission to bring Kotlin everywhere‚Äîacross platforms, industries, and teams. With his technical leadership and community perspective, Sergei will play a key role in shaping the future of the language and its ecosystem.\n\nPlease join us in giving him a warm welcome! üëè","fields":{"slug":"/news/sergei-rybalkin-joins-kotlin-foundation-board/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"August 05, 2025","title":"üöÄ Welcome Sergei Rybalkin to the Kotlin Foundation Board!","spoilerSize":260}},{"id":"219b84c1-5228-5a4f-960b-2986334b305f","excerpt":"We‚Äôre excited to announce that Meta has joined the Kotlin Foundation as the first Gold Member. Welcoming such a major technology leader adds a great perspective from a company operating at scale, and opens up new possibilities to help us to achieve our mission to have Kotlin everywhere. Meta has long been an advocate for modern, expressive programming languages, and Kotlin has played an increasingly important role in their development practices. From Android apps to multiplatform exploration, Kotlin has become a strategic part of Meta‚Äôs developer toolkit.\n\nMeta has also been an active contributor to the wider ecosystem. Notably, they were one of the founding participants of the enterprise Java-to-Kotlin working group‚Äîa collaborative effort with Google, JetBrains, and Uber aimed at supporting companies migrating large Java codebases to Kotlin. This group continues to help shape tooling, best practices, and large-scale migration strategies.\n\nIn addition, Meta supports important infrastructure efforts in the Kotlin ecosystem, including work on the Kotlin and Android build toolchain in Buck with a focus on improving build speeds and scalability, as well as contributions to libraries such as the Kotlin formatter, helping teams maintain consistent and idiomatic Kotlin codebases more easily.\n\nAs a Gold Member of the Kotlin Foundation, Meta will contribute to key initiatives such as the Kotlin Grants program for OSS contributors and educational efforts like the Kotlin Multiplatform student contest.\n\nWe‚Äôre really happy to collaborate with Meta and look forward to the expertise and scale they bring to the Foundation‚Äôs mission.\n\nTo learn more about the Kotlin Foundation and how to get involved, visit the Membership page.\n\nLet‚Äôs keep shaping the future of Kotlin‚Äîtogether.","fields":{"slug":"/news/meta-joins-kotlin-foundation-first-gold-member/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 22, 2025","title":"Meta Joins the Kotlin Foundation as the first Gold Member","spoilerSize":250}}]}}}
