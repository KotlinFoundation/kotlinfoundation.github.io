Welcoming such a major technology leader adds a great perspective from a company operating at scale, and opens up new possibilities to help us to achieve our mission to have Kotlin everywhere. Meta has long been an advocate for modern, expressive programming languages, and Kotlin has played an increasingly important role in their development practices. From Android apps to multiplatform exploration, Kotlin has become a strategic part of Meta’s developer toolkit.\n\nMeta has also been an active contributor to the wider ecosystem. Notably, they were one of the founding participants of the enterprise Java-to-Kotlin working group—a collaborative effort with Google, JetBrains, and Uber aimed at supporting companies migrating large Java codebases to Kotlin. This group continues to help shape tooling, best practices, and large-scale migration strategies.\n\nIn addition, Meta supports important infrastructure efforts in the Kotlin ecosystem, including work on the Kotlin and Android build toolchain in Buck with a focus on improving build speeds and scalability, as well as contributions to libraries such as the Kotlin formatter, helping teams maintain consistent and idiomatic Kotlin codebases more easily.\n\nAs a Gold Member of the Kotlin Foundation, Meta will contribute to key initiatives such as the Kotlin Grants program for OSS contributors and educational efforts like the Kotlin Multiplatform student contest.\n\nWe’re really happy to collaborate with Meta and look forward to the expertise and scale they bring to the Foundation’s mission.\n\nTo learn more about the Kotlin Foundation and how to get involved, visit the Membership page.\n\nLet’s keep shaping the future of Kotlin—together.","fields":{"slug":"/news/meta-joins-kotlin-foundation-first-gold-member/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 22, 2025","title":"Meta Joins the Kotlin Foundation as the first Gold Member","spoilerSize":250}},{"id":"ff1fb5ef-a88f-5f6e-aca8-5fabf66fef77","excerpt":"We’re excited to announce that Block, Inc. has joined the Kotlin Foundation as a Silver Member! Block is dedicated to increasing access to the global economy through its innovative technology. With brands like Square, Cash App, Afterpay, TIDAL, Bitkey, and Proto, Block is making significant strides in transforming commerce, finance, and digital services for everyone.\n\nThis milestone highlights a special, shared history between our engineering teams and the Kotlin community. Block’s journey with Kotlin dates back to 2015, when Square became one of the early adopters of Kotlin for Android, choosing Kotlin for production with Project Kotlin.\n\nThis deep commitment to Kotlin is more than just adoption – Block has actively contributed to Kotlin’s ecosystem. Square’s engineers have developed several popular open-source libraries like OkHttp, the default HTTP client on Android, and Okio, which has now inspired Kotlinx-io, JetBrains’ new multiplatform I/O library. These libraries set benchmarks in reliability and performance, and have been Kotlin-friendly from the start. Additionally, Block’s early adoption of Kotlin Multiplatform allowed their teams to collaborate on a single codebase, sharing business logic across Android, iOS, and backend systems.\n\nAs a Silver Member, Block will continue to support the Kotlin community through funding, expertise, and participation in shaping the future of Kotlin. Their involvement helps ensure Kotlin’s continued growth, especially in industries like fintech.\n\nIn addition to Block’s exciting partnership, we’re also celebrating Meta joining as a Gold Member.\n\nWe’re excited to collaborate with both Block and Meta, and look forward to the valuable expertise and scale they’ll bring to the Kotlin Foundation’s mission.\n\nTo learn more about the Kotlin Foundation and how to get involved, visit the Membership page.\n\nLet’s keep shaping the future of Kotlin—together.","fields":{"slug":"/news/block-joins-kotlin-foundation-silver-member/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"May 22, 2025","title":"Block Joins the Kotlin Foundation as a Silver Member","spoilerSize":250}}]}}}
